# lecture 2: Dealing with Data

The essence of OOP is designing and extending your own data types

- address in C/CPP is also a variable
- void is a type(function)

## Fundamental types

- Fundamental types
  - Integers
  - Floating-point numbers

### Integral Variables

several choices:

- char, short, int, long, long long
- differ in the amount of memory
- unsigned types, bool type
- base 10, base 8, base 16
  - first digit or two for prefix
  - base 8: 0123
  - base 16: 0x123
- const Qualifier

### Floating-point Numbers

- stores numbers with fractional parts in two parts
  - value, scales
- standard notation and E notation
- precision and print output

### Cpp Arithmetic Operators

- +, -, *, /, %
- order of operation
- type conversions
  - truncation, not rounding
  - auto declarations in cpp11

## Compound types

- Compound types
  - arrays
  - strings
  - pointers
  - structures

### Array

- data form that can hold several values, all of one type
- initialization rules
